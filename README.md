# Vecchia-Inducing Points Full-Scale Approximation (VIF)

In this repository, we provide the complete code for simulated and real-world experiments conducted in the paper "Vecchia-Inducing Points Full-Scale Approximations for Gaussian Processes". 

The  methods for VIF approximations are implemented in the **GPBoost** package, available here: [https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost](https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost).

## Repository Structure

- **`Data`**  
  Provides scripts for generating data for both the simulation studies and real-world experiments.

- **`Simulation`**
  Provides scripts for generating data for the simulation studies and the generated Data used for the experiments.
  Contains scripts to run the simulation experiments. Refer to the `README.md` file in the `Simulation` folder for a detailed description of the various simulations and how to execute them.

- **`Real World`**  
  Includes scripts and data for the real-world application.
