# Full-Scale Vecchia Approximation

In this repository, we provide the complete code for all simulated and real-world experiments conducted in the paper "...". Most experiments were implemented in Python, while the simulated data was generated using the ```R``` package ```RandomFields```. For details, refer to the script ```Generate_Simulated_Data.R```.
